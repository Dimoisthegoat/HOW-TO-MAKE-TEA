<p> At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day</p>
<p> On top of that, studies have shown teas can protect your teeth and your heart</p>



<h2 style="color:Orange"> INGREDIENTS </h2>

<p> Tea bag </p>
<p> Water </p>
<p> Milk - Dairy/Plant-based (Optional) </p>
<p> Sugar/Honey (Optional) </p>


<h3 syle="color:Orange"> PREPARATION </h3>

<p> 1 Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, </p>
<p>   and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour! </p>
<p> 2 Pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug) </p>
<p> 3 Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly. </p>
<p> 4 Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing.</p>
<p>   This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.</p> 
<p> 5 Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug.</p>
<p>   Not too much or you'll make it bitter.</p>
<p> 6 If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.</p>
<p> 7 Enjoy!</p>
